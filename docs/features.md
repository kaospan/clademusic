## 🎵 Harmonic Analysis & Discovery

### Core Analysis Engine
- **Relative Theory-Based Analysis** — All harmony stored as Roman numerals (I-V-vi-IV), not absolute chords
- **Hybrid Pipeline** — Cache-first approach with async ML processing for new tracks
- **Confidence Scoring** — Every analysis includes confidence level (0.0-1.0) and provisional flag
- **Model Versioning** — Track which analysis model version generated each result
- **90-Day Caching** — Aggressive result caching for cost efficiency at scale

### Music Theory Features
- **Roman Numeral Progressions** — Visual chord badges showing relative harmony
- **Cadence Detection** — Identify resolution patterns (authentic, plagal, deceptive, loop, etc.)
- **Loop Structure** — Detect harmonic loop length in bars
- **Modal Color** — Recognize modes beyond major/minor (dorian, mixolydian, etc.)
- **Key & Tempo Detection** — BPM and detected key with confidence scores
- **Section-Aware Analysis** — Different progressions for verse, chorus, bridge

### Smart Similarity
- **Progression Shape Matching** (50% weight) — Find tracks with similar Roman numeral sequences
- **Cadence Behavior** (20% weight) — Match by resolution patterns
- **Loop Length** (15% weight) — Same bar structure
- **Modal Color** (10% weight) — Same tonal mode
- **Tempo Proximity** (5% weight) — BPM similarity
- **Progression Rotation** — Detect rotated progressions (I-V-vi-IV ≈ V-vi-IV-I)
- **Genre-Agnostic** — Similarity based on harmony, not metadata

### Search Capabilities
- **Chord Progression Search** — Find songs by pattern (e.g., "I-V-vi-IV" or "vi-IV-I-V")
- **Progression Archetypes** — Browse popular patterns (Axis, Canon, Andalusian, Blues)
- **Song/Artist Search** — Unified search with Spotify integration
- **Search History** — Recent searches with one-tap repeat
