## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Relative Theory-First
All harmonic data stored as **Roman numerals** (I-V-vi-IV), never absolute chords. Absolute keys derived only for display.

### Hybrid Analysis Pipeline
Cache-first approach → Async job queue → ML processing → Result storage. Non-blocking UI with provisional results.

### Similarity by Harmony
Tracks matched by: Progression shape (50%), Cadence (20%), Loop length (15%), Modal color (10%), Tempo (5%). Genre is a secondary signal.
